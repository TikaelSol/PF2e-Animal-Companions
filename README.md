# PF2e-Animal-Companions

Install this module by pasting this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TikaelSol/PF2e-Animal-Companions/main/module.json

into the install module dialog on the Foundry Add-on Module tab.

Once enabled in a world it will add 3 compendiums:
- The first contains all the animal companions released as of March 2021 statted up as ancestries to enable Foundry automation, as well as an Animal Companion class.  Just drag the correct ones to the PC sheet you are using for your Animal Companion.
- The second contains feats to automate the Mature, Nimble, and Savage damage bonuses (other bonuses are not automated).  Drag these feats to the animal companion sheet when your PC takes the associated feat.
- The last contains the ancestry features linked to by the Ancestries.  You should not need to drag these to the sheet, they should automatically be added by the ancestries.

The name of the Animal Companion class and the ancestry can be edited once dragged to your sheet.

An Animal Companion specific sheet is in the works for the PF2e system, but until that is ready this can serve as a way to use the PF2e system automation.
