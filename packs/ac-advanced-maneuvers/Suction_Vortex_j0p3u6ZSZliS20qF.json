The drake attempts an @Check[athletics|against:fortitude] check against the foe's Fortitude DC. On a success, the ravenous drake pulls the foe up to 10 feet to be adjacent to it. This movement is forced movement. On a critical success, the foe is also grabbed by the drake's jaws until the beginning of your next turn.</p>",
