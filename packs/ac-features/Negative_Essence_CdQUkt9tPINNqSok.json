This renders it a living creature and therefore susceptible to many ailments that bother only the living, though it does possess some resistances to these effects. The eidolon has negative healing, meaning it heals from negative energy effects that heal undead and is damaged by positive energy effects that damage undead. It doesn't have an undead's normal immunities, but it does gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against death effects, disease, and poison effects, and non-damaging effects that target only undead. Additionally, its necrotic essence stanches its wounds easily. The flat check to remove persistent bleed damage from the eidolon is DC 10 (or DC 5 after receiving particularly effective aid).</p>"
