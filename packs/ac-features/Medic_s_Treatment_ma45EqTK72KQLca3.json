If a creature has multiple conditions from this list, the medic chooses one to treat. The medic attempts a counteract check against the condition, using their @Check[medicine] modifier as their counteract modifier and half their level as the counteract rank. The condition's source determines the DC.</p><p>The medic can't treat a condition that came from an artifact or an effect above 20th level. Using Medic's Treatment on a condition that is continually applied (for instance, the enfeebled condition a holy creature gains from carrying an unholy weapon) has no effect as long as the circumstances continue.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Reduce the chosen condition's value by 2.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> Reduce the chosen condition's value by 1.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Increase the chosen condition's value by 1.</p>",
