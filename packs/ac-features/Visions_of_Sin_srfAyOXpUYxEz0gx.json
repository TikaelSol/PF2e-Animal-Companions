The target must attempt a Will save against your spell DC with the following effects. The effects last until the end of your next turn, but your eidolon can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to extend the effects until the end of your next turn (like Sustaining a Spell), to a maximum duration of 1 minute. If the target is evil, it takes a -2 circumstance penalty to its save. Regardless of whether it succeeds, the target becomes temporarily immune for 1 day.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target can't use reactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Slowed]{Slowed 1} and can't use reactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, and the target is also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Confused]{Confused} for 1 round. The confusion can't be extended, but the other effects can.</p>"
