      "value": "<p>Your eidolon is an intelligent swarm composed of hundreds of Tiny creatures, and it's immune to the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone}, and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VcDeM8A5oI6VqhbM]{Restrained} conditions. It can fit through tight spaces as though it were a Tiny creature. It has weakness to area damage equal to its level. Your eidolon has two forms: condensed and dispersed. When you Manifest Eidolon, it manifests condensed. It can switch between these two forms as a single action that has the concentrate trait.</p><p><strong>Condensed Form:</strong> When condensed, your eidolon draws all its component bodies into a single, condensed mound that functions as a Medium creature. It has a reach of 5 feet, can make Strikes, and can't occupy the same space as other creatures. While condensed, it can use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-animal-companions.AC-Features.Item.roBX7VxpVKkRpClJ]{Haunting Visage} action.</p><p><strong>Dispersed Form:</strong> When dispersed, your eidolon scatters its component bodies across a wider area, increasing its size by one category (to Large for most swarm eidolons). It has a reach of 0 feet, can't make Strikes, and can occupy the same space as other creatures. While dispersed, it can use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-animal-companions.AC-Features.Item.fUTBJxjPmiP4KVVI]{Swarming Assault} activity.</p>",
