Until the start of your next turn, as long as your crab is within your reach, your ranged Strikes that deal damage to a creature within 30 feet make the target @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} until the end of your next turn. Your crab scuttles or launches itself back to the same space from which you threw it immediately after making a Strike, allowing you to hurl it multiple times.</p>",
